// Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest sub-sequence such that elements in the subsequence are consecutive integers, the consecutive numbers can be in any order.
//
//Examples:
//
//Input: arr[] = {1, 9, 3, 10, 4, 20, 2}
//Output: 4
//Explanation:
//The subsequence 1, 3, 4, 2 is the longest
//subsequence of consecutive elements

// Solution:
// Create an empty hash.
// Insert all array elements to hash.
// Do following for every element arr[i]
// Check if this element is the starting point of a subsequence. To check this, simply look for arr[i] â€“ 1 in the hash, if not found, then this is the first element a subsequence.
// If this element is the first element, then count the number of elements in the consecutive starting with this element. Iterate from arr[i] + 1 till the last element that can be found.
// If the count is more than the previous longest subsequence found, then update this.

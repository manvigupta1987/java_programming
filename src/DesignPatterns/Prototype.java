// Creational Design Pattern
//Prototype design pattern is used when the Object creation is a costly affair and requires a lot of time and resources and you have a similar object already existing.
//Prototype pattern provides a mechanism to copy the original object to a new object and then modify it according to our needs. Prototype design pattern uses java cloning
// to copy the object.

//It would be easy to understand prototype design pattern with an example. Suppose we have an Object that loads data from database. Now we need to modify this data
// in our program multiple times, so itâ€™s not a good idea to create the Object using new keyword and load all the data again from database.
//The better approach would be to clone the existing object into a new object and then do the data manipulation

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

// Shallow cloning or deep cloning depends on the developer.
